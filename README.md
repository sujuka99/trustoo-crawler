# Trustoo crawler

My entry to Trustoo's hiring challenge.

## Case 1

### Context

Trustoo has a long succesrate of selling leads to lawyers in NL. The category is live for over 4 years now.

### Objective

During the last 4 years new lawyer businesses likely have started. Next, businesses that failed to meet our quality standards 4 years ago probably now do fit our requirements. Our base of the best possible lawyers might be incomplete.

### Assignment

One of the websites we use a lot in the Netherlands to find candidate businesses is the Yellow Pages: [Gouden Gids](https://www.goudengids.nl/). Create a Python scraper to extract as much useful information as possible to help us adding more Lawyers on our platform. Include comments in your code to explain your choices and setup.
